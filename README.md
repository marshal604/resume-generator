## Overview

Previously, I created resumes in Word, but adjusting the layout was troublesome. Therefore, I wanted to create my own customized resume. Currently, there is only one style, but I will add more templates in the future if I come across or think of nice ones.

Additionally, [Cake](https://www.cake.me/dashboard) is already an excellent resume building website.
